**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my previous work analyzing the relationship between customers, vendors and products, I will incorporate ethics into consideration. I will ensure that data collection and usage practices are transparent and respect the privacy and consent of all parties involved. I will clearly communicate with customers and vendors how their data is collected, stored, used and obtaining explicit consent. In addition, I will implement stringent data protection measures limited the access to the SQL database and safeguard sensitive information.

For inequity components of this data analysis, I would add another analysis to assess whether minority-owned vendors (which is small inventory, or less product category) receive quitable opportunities compared to larger inventory and variety of product category vendors. By join vendor, vendor inventory, product category, customer purchases tables to see if the larger inventory or variety product catefory vendors has more profit than the small scale vendors.
